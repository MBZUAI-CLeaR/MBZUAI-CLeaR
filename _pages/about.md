Welcome to the MBZUAI-CLeaR Group! CLeaR (Causal Learning and Reasoning) is a research group led by <a href='https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/kun-zhang/' target="_blank">Professor Kun Zhang</a> at <a href='https://mbzuai.ac.ae/' target='_blank'>Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)</a> .

We specialize in research and projects centered around causal learning. The team is committed to advancing the understanding and application of causal inference, modeling, and reasoning in artificial intelligence. MBZUAI-CLeaR aims to explore and elucidate the intricate mechanisms of causality, striving to develop innovative AI systems that can not only predict outcomes but also understand the underlying causal relationships. This focus on causal learning is crucial for creating more robust, interpretable, and trustworthy AI technologies, bridging the gap between correlation and causation to solve real-world problems more effectively.
